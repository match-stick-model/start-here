# Start Here
This an opportunity to talk about open source and our values and also provide a guide to contributing to our open source community. Start here if you are not familiar with open source projects.

it's going to be a page where we give an overview of everything, a place to onboard people that links to all the other repos and explains how everything works

we can make a website page out of this using github pages

* Submit an idea or apply for funding? https://github.com/match-stick-model/funding
* Help with the website? https://github.com/match-stick-model/website

Proof of concept 
* Open Source Guides are a good example https://github.com/github/opensource.guide
* Open Source Friday has goo guides we can emulate https://opensourcefriday.com/

### What does “open source” mean?
When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.

### To understand how it works, imagine your friend is having a dinner party, and you bring an apple pie.

* Everybody tries the pie (use)
* The pie is a hit! They ask you for the recipe, which you provide (view)
* One friend, Alex, who’s a pastry chef, suggests reducing the sugar (modify)
* Another friend, Lisa, asks to use it for a dinner next week (distribute)

By comparison, a closed source process would be going to a restaurant and ordering a slice of cherry pie. You must pay a fee to eat the pie, and the restaurant probably won’t give you their recipe. If you copied their pie exactly and sold it under your own name, the restaurant could take action against you.

### How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

* *If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.*
* *If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first.* That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
