# Start Here
This an opportunity to talk about open source and our values and also provide a guide to contributing to our open source community. Start here if you are not familiar with open source projects.

it's going to be a page where we give an overview of everything, a place to onboard people that links to all the other repos and explains how everything works

we can make a website page out of this using github pages

## What does “open source” mean? [link](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

* Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.
* Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.
* Why do people contribute to open source? Plenty of reasons!
* Improve the community you rely on. Lots of open source contributors start by being members of the community they contribute to. When you find a bug or have an idea. If that’s the case, then contributing is the best way to ensure that your friends (and yourself when you update to the next release) will be able to benefit from it.
* Improve existing skills. Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
* Meet people who are interested in similar things
* Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
* Find mentors and teach others. Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
* Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career). By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.
* Learn people skills. Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
* It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones.

You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.

### To understand how it works, imagine your friend is having a dinner party, and you bring an apple pie.

* Everybody tries the pie (use)
* The pie is a hit! They ask you for the recipe, which you provide (view)
* One friend, Alex, who’s a pastry chef, suggests reducing the sugar (modify)
* Another friend, Lisa, asks to use it for a dinner next week (distribute)

By comparison, a closed source process would be going to a restaurant and ordering a slice of cherry pie. You must pay a fee to eat the pie, and the restaurant probably won’t give you their recipe. If you copied their pie exactly and sold it under your own name, the restaurant could take action against you.

### How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

* **If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.**
* **If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first.** That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
